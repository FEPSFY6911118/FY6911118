      From its foundation in 1958 (O’Neill, A. (2022).) , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led America’s space programmes.
      Billions of dollars of government money  were poured into making sure that American boots were the first to walk on the moon. 
In 1962, US President John F. Kennedy famously said: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy,
      but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is
      one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.” (Kennedy, J. (2019).)  
Kennedy and the moon landings inspired generations to have an interest in space exploration. But for the following four decades, space travel
      and exploration globally were only carried out by government run and funded organisations like NASA, Roscosmos (The Russian Space Agency)
      and the European Space Agency (Solomon, L.D. (2017).) . 
Then, on May 30, 2020, we saw the dawn of a new space era. For the first time in space history humans flew in a spacecraft built not by a
      governmental organisation but by a private sector venture.

  Until November 2003, governments were the only organisations to send architecture into orbit however since then we have entered a new era of 
      commercialised companies starting to take the stage. 
By the early 2000s, NASA was encouraging (PREPUBLICATION COPY-SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION NASA’s Strategic 
Direction and the Need for a National Consensus. (n.d.).)  commercial organisations to develop space architecture. Commercial space has gained 
      momentum since 2006 and in 2012 (Eldridge, A. (2019).)  there were the first initiatives related to space tourism, and the access to space 
      along with the growing interest in small satellites. This sudden acceleration was started by a revolution in Silicon Valley which promptly 
      spread worldwide as more companies aimed bigger to hit larger targets e.g. the International Space Station. 
  	
In 2004, Michael W. Melvill became the first man to reach space in a privately developed programme. His craft, SpaceShipOne, was designed 
      by Burt Rutan with the help of Microsoft billionaire Paul G. Allan. It went on to claim the Ansari X Prize, an international competition to 
      launch people into space without government assistance that had begun in 1996 (Vance, A. (2015).). 
Meanwhile, in June 2002, billionaire Elon Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) with the mission to emerge as “the Southwest Airlines 
      of Space”. As a private company, Musk said SpaceX would avoid the cost overruns associated with government contractors. He said,
      “they were building a Ferrari for every launch, when it was possible that a Honda Accord might do the trick.”  
SpaceX would be lean and fast, like a start-up, and take advantage of advances in computing power. In 2012, SpaceX’s Dragon craft became the first
      commercially built spacecraft to transport cargo to the ISS (updated, M.W. last (2023).) . Then in 2020, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket took NASA
      astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug 
Hurley to the ISS, the first time a commercial company was used to transport crew (Grossman, L. (2020).) . 
The main advantages are that it reduces the cost to the government so they have more budget to work on other problems. Commercialisation of space 
      transportation also increases the encouragement to innovate and increase investment into space. 
The main disadvantages are with more people trying to reach space it increases the amount of space debris and so has a large environmental impact. 
      Also there is a lack of regulation in the private sector and so it means the safety checks are less so the spacecraft are less safe compared
      with those of NASA. Finally monopolisation is one of the main reasons against commercialising space travel as it means a small group of people
      control the market and so profit off of it.

In conclusion, there are many advantages and some disadvantages to the commercialisation of space travel and transportation but from the facts 
      I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the involvement of private sector companies in the space sector is a good thing.  
However, there is still a role of government organisations, such as NASA, to play in space exploration with support from private companies. 
      Involving the private sector means that government organisations can achieve more in space exploration, more efficiently and the pace of
      innovation is
quicker. 
The commercialisation of space travel and transportation will help to further mankind’s space exploration ambitions and could see humans on Mars 
      within a quarter of a century (dominic bliss (2018).) . Becoming  an interplanetary species could be vital if astrophysicist Stephen Hawkings
      was correct. In 2006, he said: “It is important for the human race to spread out into space for the survival of the species. Life on Earth is
      at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster, such as sudden global warming, nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or 
      other dangers we have not yet thought of.” (Hawking, S (6,6))
